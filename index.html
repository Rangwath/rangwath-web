                <p>
                    Greetings and welcome to my world of game development. From the moment I laid my hands on the my father's Atari
                    800XL as
                    a child, my fascination with the realm of gaming was ignited. What started as a childhood passion evolved into a
                    lifelong
                    dream of creating my own games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite my career taking me elsewhere into the exciting world of fintech after pursuing an IT degree at university,
                    my love for gaming never wavered. However, it was during the unprecedented times of the global pandemic that I
                    discovered my passion for game development. Amidst the uncertainties, I delved into the world of game development through 
                    Unity courses offered by the great team of <a href="https://www.gamedev.tv/">GameDev.tv</a>, reigniting the spark that had 
                    always been there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, during my spare moments, you can find me exploring the features of Unity game engine or piecing together
                    concepts for my next game. Each day is a new opportunity to expand my skill set and dive deeper into the beauty of
                    game design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My ultimate goal is to release a game on Steam that brings joy and allows at least a few people to momentarily escape
                    the
                    realities of life, just as I did when I lost myself in the world of Bruce Lee and Zorro on the Atari 800XL. I
                    believe in the
                    power of gaming to offer solace and respite, and I am dedicated to creating an experience that can transport players
                    to
                    a world of wonder and excitement, even if just for a while.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On this website, you'll find an assortment of games created by me, utilizing a mix of free and paid assets, as well
                    as games developed in collaboration with a small team of friends during thrilling game jams. Each creation
                    represents a unique journey and a labor of love, demonstrating our shared passion for games.
